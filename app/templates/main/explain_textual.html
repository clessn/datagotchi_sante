                    Your mental health score is {{ explain_dic.predicted_score }}. This score reflects how some of your lifestyle habits influence your overall well-being, based on patterns we've observed in a large group of people. Let me explain this without technical jargon:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found that <strong>{{ explain_dic.n_informative }}</strong> key questions had the most impact on your mental health score:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    {% for question_id, (question_label, question_content, question_description, _, _) in explain_dic.feature_content_dic.items() %}
                    <li>
                        <strong>{{ question_content }}</strong>: {{ question_description }}
                    </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These factors combined explain most of your score. The remaining points come from other areas in your life, such as your daily stress levels, eating habits, or work-life balance. These areas are harder to capture but still contribute to your overall mental health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this tool is to help you understand where you might focus your energy to improve your well-being. Based on your responses, small changes in these areas could make a meaningful difference to your mental health.
