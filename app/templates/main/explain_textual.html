                    Based on your answers, the algorithm estimated your current well-being score: <strong>{{ explain_dic.predicted_score }}</strong>. 
                </p>

                    This score reflects how some of your lifestyle habits influence your overall well-being, based on patterns we've observed in a large group of people. Let me explain this without technical jargon:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found that <strong>{{ explain_dic.n_informative }}</strong> key questions had the most impact on your well-being score:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    {% for question_id, (question_label, question_content, question_description, _, _, question_explain) in explain_dic.feature_content_dic.items() %}
                    <li class="question-item">
                        <strong>{{ question_content }}</strong> 
                        <br />
                        Your answer to this question was: "<em>{{ question_explain }}</em>"
                        <button class="dropdown-toggle">Why is this important?</button>
                        <div class="dropdown-content">
                            <p>{{ question_description }}</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These factors combined explain most of your score. The remaining points come from other areas in your life, such as your daily stress levels, eating habits, or work-life balance. These areas are harder to capture but still contribute to your overall well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this tool is to help you understand where you might focus your energy to improve your well-being. Based on your responses, small changes in these areas could make a meaningful difference to your well-being.
