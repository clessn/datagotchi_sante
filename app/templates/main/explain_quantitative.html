                    Based on your answers, the algorithm estimated your current well-being score: <strong>{{ explain_dic.predicted_score }}</strong>. It is calculated based on how you answered <strong>{{ explain_dic.n_informative }}</strong> key lifestyle questions. These questions are particularly important because our analysis showed they are the best indicators of well-being. Here's how your score was determined:
                </p>
                <p><ol>
                {% for question_id, (question_label, question_content, _, question_coefficient, question_value, _) in explain_dic.feature_content_dic.items() %}
                <li><strong>{{ question_content }}</strong>: This contributes <strong>{{ (question_coefficient * question_value) | round  }}</strong> points to your score.</li>
                {% endfor %}
                </ol></p>

                <p><strong>Total Contribution:</strong> Adding these factors together: <strong>{{ explain_dic.intermediate_predicted_score }}</strong> points.</p>

                <p><strong>The Remaining Points:</strong> The rest of your score, 
                <strong>{{ explain_dic.predicted_score }} - {{ explain_dic.intermediate_predicted_score }}</strong> = <strong>{{ explain_dic.predicted_score - explain_dic.intermediate_predicted_score }}</strong> points, come from your responses to other lifestyle and socio-demographic questions. These questions collectively play a smaller role in the prediction but still provide additional insights into your well-being.</p>

                <p><strong>Why This Explanation Matters:</strong> This breakdown shows how much each factor influences your score. For instance, the most influential questions highlight the areas where small changes could significantly impact your well-being score.</p>
