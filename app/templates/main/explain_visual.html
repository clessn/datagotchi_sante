                    Your mental health score is <strong>{{ explain_dic.predicted_score }}</strong>. The radar chart highlights 
                    <strong>{{ explain_dic.n_informative }}</strong> key aspects of your lifestyle that significantly influence this score. Let me explain how these factors contribute to your overall well-being:

                    These factors together explain the majority of your score. The radar chart visually represents how well-balanced these areas are in your life and suggests areas where small improvements could lead to better mental health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The remaining points come from other aspects of your lifestyle and environment that are not captured in the radar chart but still contribute to your overall mental health. These might include factors like daily stress levels, diet, or work-life balance.

                    This tool aims to help you identify which aspects of your lifestyle have the most influence on your mental health and where you might want to focus your attention to feel better overall. Small, consistent changes in these areas could make a meaningful difference.
