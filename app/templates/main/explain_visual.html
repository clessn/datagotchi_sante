                    Your well-being score is <strong>{{ explain_dic.predicted_score }}</strong>. The radar chart highlights 
                    <strong>{{ explain_dic.n_informative }}</strong> key aspects of your lifestyle that significantly influence this score. Let me explain how these factors contribute to your overall well-being:

                    These factors together explain the majority of your score. The radar chart visually represents how well-balanced these areas are in your life and suggests areas where small improvements could lead to better well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The remaining points come from other aspects of your lifestyle and environment that are not captured in the radar chart but still contribute to your overall well-being. These might include factors like daily stress levels, diet, or work-life balance.

                    This tool aims to help you identify which aspects of your lifestyle have the most influence on your well-being and where you might want to focus your attention to feel better overall. Small, consistent changes in these areas could make a meaningful difference.
