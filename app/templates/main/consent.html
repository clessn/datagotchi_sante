                    <strong>Title of the Study</strong><br>
    Raising Mental Health Awareness Through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)<br><br>

    <strong>Introduction of the Research Team</strong><br>
    This project is conducted by Simon Coulombe, researcher at VITAM – Centre de recherche en santé durable – and professor at the Department of Industrial Relations at Université Laval; 
    Flore Vancompernolle Vromman, doctoral researcher at LouRIM – Louvain Research Institute in Management and Organizations at UCLouvain (Belgium); 
    Corentin Vande Kerckhove, researcher at LouRIM and professor at Louvain School of Management at UCLouvain (Belgium); 
    Yannick Dufresne, researcher at VITAM and professor at the Department of Political Science at Université Laval; 
    Joël Gagnon, researcher at the Department of Industrial Relations at Université Laval; 
    Camille Pelletier, student member at VITAM and master student in Political Science at Université Laval.<br><br>

    <strong>Project Information</strong><br>
    Your participation in the questionnaire will allow us to scientifically measure various attitudes, perceptions, or behaviors related to your health and well-being. 
    Based on your questionnaire responses and an artificial intelligence model developed using a sample of individuals in Canada, the questionnaire will provide you with information 
    about your mental health in the form of a predicted well-being score (generated by an algorithm). In addition to the well-being score, you will receive explanations directly in 
    the questionnaire that may help you better understand the predictions generated by the algorithm. We aim to identify which types of explanations are the clearest, most understandable, 
    and most useful for participants to help them comprehend and improve their mental health. The study results may also serve as a basis for educational and preventive interventions, 
    promoting better personal management of mental health.<br><br>

    <strong>Your Participation</strong><br>
    Your participation in this research involves completing this questionnaire, which consists of 70-80 questions and takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. 
    Please note that answering all questions is necessary to rigorously test our machine learning algorithm and to provide you with a more realistic prediction of your well-being score. 
    However, you are free to skip any question that makes you uncomfortable. In such cases, we invite you to end your participation by closing your browser page. 
    Since no personally identifiable information (e.g., name, contact details) will be collected in the questionnaire, data obtained from participants who choose to withdraw from the study cannot be deleted.<br><br>

    <strong>Anonymity and Data Retention</strong><br>
    The responses collected through this survey will only be accessible to researchers in an aggregated, anonymous, and non-attributable form. 
    These data may be retained for further analysis or future academic research projects on mental health and/or algorithm explainability. 
    Information that could identify you (such as the email address provided for the Interac transfer compensation) will be stored in a separate database from your questionnaire responses 
    and will be deleted as soon as the Interac transfer is completed. The collected data is used exclusively for academic research purposes and will never be sold, shared, or transferred to third parties for other purposes.<br><br>

    <strong>Potential Risks or Discomforts</strong><br>
    The questionnaire may evoke memories and/or emotions that are difficult or uncomfortable for you. 
    You may take a break at any time and may stop the questionnaire if you wish. Below, you will find links to available support resources:<br><br>

    <strong><a href="https://www.ccmhs-ccsms.ca/education/mh-resources-en" target="_blank">Resources</a></strong><br><br>
    This link will be presented again at the end of the questionnaire.<br><br>

    <strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br>
    Your collaboration is valuable in helping us conduct this study. We sincerely appreciate the time and attention you dedicate to your participation. 
    To thank you for participating in the study, you will have the opportunity at the end of the questionnaire to provide your email address to receive a CAD 10 Interac transfer.<br><br>

    <strong>Consent Confirmation</strong><br>
    Completing the online questionnaire (which begins on the next page) will be considered an implicit expression of your consent to participate in the project.<br><br>
