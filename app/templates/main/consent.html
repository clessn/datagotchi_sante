                    <strong>Consent Form for Participation in a Scientific Experiment</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Title of the Study:</strong> Explainability in Mental Health Prediction: Understanding the Role of Lifestyle Variables<br><br>
                    <strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong> You are invited to participate in a scientific study conducted by researchers at UCLouvain. The purpose of this experiment is to explore how different methods of explaining AI predictions influence understanding, satisfaction, and decision-making in the context of mental health.<br><br>
                    <strong>What Participation Involves:</strong><br>
                    If you agree to participate, you will be asked to:
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Provide basic information about your lifestyle (e.g., sleep, exercise, social interactions).</li>
                        <li>Interact with an AI model that predicts mental health scores based on lifestyle variables.</li>
                        <li>Receive explanations about the predictions in one of several formats (e.g., text, visual, contextual).</li>
                        <li>Answer questionnaires before and after the interaction to assess your knowledge, satisfaction, and intent to act on the lifestyle variables.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The entire process will take approximately 30 minutes.<br><br>
                    <strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong><br>
                    Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may withdraw at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits.<br><br>
                    <strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br>
                    Your data will be anonymized, meaning it cannot be traced back to you personally. The information collected will only be used for research purposes and will be stored securely on encrypted servers. Aggregated results may be published in scientific journals or presented at conferences, but no individual data will be identifiable.<br><br>
                    <strong>Risks and Benefits:</strong><br>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li><strong>Risks:</strong> This study poses minimal risk to participants. However, discussing topics related to mental health may evoke emotional reactions. If you experience discomfort, you may stop participating at any time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> While there is no direct benefit to you, your participation will contribute to advancing knowledge in the fields of AI and mental health.</li>
                    </ul>
